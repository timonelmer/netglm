\arguments{
\item{dvs}{a list of matrices where each matrix represents the dependent network of one group. Cells of the matrix indicating the presence of a tie (1 = tie, 0 = no tie for binary variables) 
or the weight of a tie (for continuous tie variables) characterizing the dependent networks}

\item{ivs}{a list of lists with where each sets of independent matrices are grouped by group and then independent variables. 
If the list is organized per independent network the argument iv.list.per = "iv" can be used to restructure the data.}

\item{iv.list.per}{lists in the ivs argument are should be nested by group and independent matrices, if this is not the case (grouped by independent matrices and then groups)
the argument iv.list.per = "iv" can be used to restructure the data.}

\item{family}{family of the generalized linear model. default is "gaussian" for continuous dependent varaibles. F
or binday dependent variables "binomial" is advised.}

\item{iv.names}{names of the independent variables for the output object}

\item{mode}{permutation method to be applied. default is "yQAP" for permuting the Y / dv
variables."dspQAP" applies Dekker's semi partialing method (Dekker, Krackhard, & Snijders, 2007)}

\item{samples}{number of permutations, default is 1000.}

\item{diag}{boolean for using the diagonal values of matrices in the estimation. default is FALSE}

\item{directed}{"directed" if the dependent network is directed (ties from A to B and B to A are possible), 
"undirected" if the dependent network is undirected (ties from A to B are identical to B to A). Default is "directed".}

\item{cpu}{number of cpu's to be used for estimation, default is 1}

\item{round.to}{numeric, numer of digits in output table}

\item{logfilename}{name of log file printing intermediate reports during the estimation procedure.}

\item{verbose}{reports of what is happening under the hood during the call of the function, default is TRUE}

\item{global.deltas}{during "dspQAP" estimation, should global or local delta values be used. default is TRUE}

\item{return.perms}{should permuted networks be part of the output? default is FALSE}
}
\description{
Estimates a MRQAP model taking the multilevel/grouped nature of the into account. 
An application and detailed description of the multigroup extension 
of MRQAP can be found in Elmer and Stadtfeld (2020).
